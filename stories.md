As a user, I want to:

  * Make games, so that I can have fun and express myself
  * Be able to express what I want without writing code
  * Experiment and iterate

In order to make games, as a user:

  * I want to be able to upload images to use in my game
  * I want to be able to position those images in rooms, and teach them to move in response to input
  * I want to record animations that describe my game
  * I want to see the computer make a game from that
  * I want to play the game that I've made
  * I want to improve the game by adding more features
  * I want to edit old animations to improve them
  * I want to be able to record playing the game and edit it
  * I want to know how close the computer's code is to my vision
  * I want my work to be automatically saved
  * I want to easily share my games with others
  * I want to be able to work together with friends on games easily
